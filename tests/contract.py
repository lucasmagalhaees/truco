"""Contract check: the readers of src/core/source.ts against real answers of the source, recorded in tests/fixtures/source/.

Usage: python3 tests/contract.py   (needs dist/ built)
The readers are written for answers that were seen, not imagined. Before the app reads a new field: record a real answer
with it in tests/fixtures/source/ (never edited by hand), add what must hold of it to EXPECT below, and only then write
the code. With no answer recorded yet there is nothing to check, and the script says so.
